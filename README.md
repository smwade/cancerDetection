#k Cancer Project

## Overview

The goal of this project is to detect cervical cancer from pap smear slides.
More than 13000 women in the United states are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year, and more than 4000 will die.
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer for women worldwide, but because it developes over time, *it is
also one of the most preventable types of cancer*.
