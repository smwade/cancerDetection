% Options for this class include the following (* indicates default):
%
%   phd (*) -- produce a dissertation
%   ms -- produce a thesis
%
%   electronic -- default official university option, overrides the following:
%                 - equalmargins
%
%   hardcopy -- overrides the following:
%                 - no equalmargins
%                 - twoside
%
%   letterpaper -- ignored, but helpful for the Makefile that I use
%
%   10pt -- 10 point font size
%   11pt -- 11 point font size
%   12pt (*) -- 12 point font size
%
%   lof -- produce a list of figures in the preamble (off)
%   lot -- produce a list of tables in the preamble (off)
%   lol -- produce a list of listings in the preamble (off)
%
%   layout -- show layout lines on the pages, helps with overfull boxes (off)
%   grid -- show a half-inch grid on every page, helps with printing (off)
%   separator -- print an extra instruction page between preamble and body (off)
%
%   twoside (*) -- two-sided output (margins alternate for odd and even pages,
%     blank pages inserted to ensure that chapters begin on the right side of a
%     bound copy, etc.)
%   oneside -- one-sided output (margins are the same on all pages)
%   equalmargins -- make all margins equal - ugly for binding, but compliant
%
%   twosidetoc - start two-sided margins at the TOC instead of the body.  This
%     is sometimes (oddly) required, but be aware that it will make the page
%     numbering seem screwy, e.g., the first four full sheets of paper will
%     have number i-iv (not shown, though), and the next sheets will each have
%     two numbers, one for each side.  I suspect that most people don't look at
%     the roman numerals anyway, but it is a weird requirement.
%
%   openright (*) -- force new chapters to start on an odd page
%   openany -- don't use this, it's ugly
%
%   prettyheadings -- make the section/chapter headings look nice
%   compliantheadings (*) -- make them look ugly, but compliant with standards
%
%   chaptercenter -- center the chapter headings horizontally
%   chapterleft (*) -- place chapter headings on the left
%
%   partmiddle -- Part headers are centered vertically, no other text on page
%   parttop (*) -- Part headers at top of page, other text expected
%
%   duplexprinter -- Ensures that the two-sided portion starts on the right
%     side when printing.  This is not for use in submission, since the best
%     thing to do there is to print everything out one-sided, then take it down
%     to the copy store to have them do the rest.  It does help to save trees
%     when you are printing out copies just to look at them and fiddle with
%     things.
%
%
% EXAMPLES:
%
% The rest is up to you.  To fiddle with margins, use the \settextwidth and
% \setbindingoffset macros, described below.  I suggest that you
% \settextwidth{6.0in} for better-looking output (otherwise you'll get 3/4-inch
% margins after binding, which is sort of weird).  This will depend on the
% opinions of the various dean/coordinator folks, though, so be sure to ask
% them before embarking on a major formatting task.

% The following command fixes my particular printer, which starts 0.03 inches
% too low, shifting the whole page down by that amount.  This shifts the
% document content up so that it comes out right when printed.
%
% Discovering this sort of behavior is best done by specifying the ``grid''
% option in the class parameters above.  It prints a 1/2 inch grid on every
% page.  You can then use a ruler to determine exactly what the printer is
% doing.
%
% Uncomment to shift content up (accounting for printer problems)
%\setlength{\voffset}{-.03in}

% Here we set things up for invisible hyperlinks in the document.  This makes
% the electronic version clickable without changing the way that the document
% prints.  It's useful, but optional.
%
% NOTE: "driverfallback=ps2pdf" chooses ps2pdf in the case of LaTeX and pdftex
% in the case of pdflatex. If you use my LaTeX makefile (at
% http://latex-makefile.googlecode.com/) then pdftex is the default There are
% many other benefits to using the makefile, too.  This option is not always
% available, so use with care.

% To fiddle with the margin settings use the below.  DO NOT change stuff
% directly (like setting \textwidth) - it will break subtle things and you'll
% be tearing your hair out.
%
% For example, if you want 1.5in equal margins, or 2in and 1in margins when
% printing, add the following below:
%
%\setbindingoffset{1.0in}
%\settextwidth{5.5in}
%
% When equalmargins is specified in the class options, the margins will be
% equal at 1.5in each: (8.5 - 5.5) / 2.  When equalmargins is not specified,
% the inner margin will be 2.0 and the outer margin will be 1.0: inner = (8.5 -
% 5.5 - 1.0) / 2 + 1.0 (the 1.0 is the binding offset).
%
% The idea is this: you determine how much space the text is going to take up,
% whether for an electronic document (equalmargins) or not.  You don't want the
% layout shifting around between printed and electronic documents.
%
% So, you specify the text width.  Then, if there is a binding offset (when
% binding your thesis, the binding takes up space - usually 0.5 inches), that
% reduces the visual space on the final printed copy.  So, the *effective*
% margins are calculated by reducing the page size by the binding offset, then
% computing the remaining space and dividing by two.  Adding back in the
% binding offset gives the inner margin.  The outer margin is just what's left.
%
% All of this is done using the geometry package, which should be manipulated
% directly at your peril.  It's best just to use the above macros to manipulate
% your margins.
%
% That said, using the geometry macro to set top and bottom margins, or
% anything else vertical, is perfectly safe and encouraged, e.g.,
%
%\geometry{top=2.0in,bottom=2.0in}
%
% Just don't fiddle with horizontal margins this way.  You have been warned.

\chapter{Introduction}

Cervical cancer accounts for 6.6\% of cancer cases in the world. In 2018 alone, there were well
over 570,000 cases. Even worse is the disproportionate way populations are effected. About 90\%
of deaths from cervical cancer came from lot to middle income countries.\cite{15}


Fortunatly the high mortality rate from cervical cancer can be reduced by effective screening and early
treatment.

\section{The pap-smear screening}

The pap-smear screening was developed by Georges Papanicolaou. The test is done by collecting cells and staining them. When they are looked at under a microscope cyto-technicians are able to detect pre-cancerous cells in the uterine
cervix. Human lableing and classification of the indavidaul cells is very time consuming and expensive since it must be preformed by skilled cyto-technicians. The goal of this project is to not do that.

Using a small brush, cotton-stick or wooden stick, a cytological sample is taken from the cervix and smeared onto a thin glass slide. 
To clarify the cells characteristics the smear is stained using the Papanicolaou method, so the different components of the cells are em- phasized with specific colors - this makes it more clear in a microscope.\cite{herlev2}


Each microscope slide contains up to 300,000 single cells with defferent orientations and overlap\cite{herlev2}

\section{Cervix Stuff}


\chapter{Datasets}

The datasets used are constructed by cyto-technicians for classification purposes. These technicians use a microsope witha resolution of  \SI{0.201}{\micro\metre} / pixel to grab every cell.


\section{SIPaKMeD}
The SIPaKMeD dataset consists of 4049 single cell images which have been manually cropped
from 996 cluser cell images of Pap smear slides. These cells are then labeled in 5 categories: (1) Dyskera- totic, (2) Koilocytotic, (3) Metaplastic, (4) Parabasal and (5) Superficial-Intermediate. 1-2 classes represent the ab- normal cervical cells, 4-5 classes represent normal cervical cells, and 3 represents the benign cells.\cite{sipakmed}

\section{Herlev}
The Herlev dataset is comprised of 917 isolated single cell images. These are distributed unequally between seven classes of cells.  (1) Superficial squamous epithelia, (2) Intermediate squamous epithelia, (3) Colum- nar epithelial, (4) Mild squamous non-keratinizing dyspla- sia, (5) Moderate squamous non-keratinizing dysplasia, (6) Severe squamous non-keratinizing dysplasia and (7) Squa-
mous cell carcinoma in situ intermediate. The classes 1-3 are normal cervical cells whereas classes 4-7 are abnormal cervical cells.\cite{herlev}

\chapter{Background}

Current automatic screening scystems that incorperate pap smear have a very similar workflow: cell segmentation, cytoplasm and nuclei segmentation, feature extraction, and cell classification.

Whole slide classification (no segmentation) \cite{kiran}
