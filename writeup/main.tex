%
%   twosidetoc - start two-sided margins at the TOC instead of the body.  This

%   parttop (*) -- Part headers at top of page, other text expected
%
%   duplexprinter -- Ensures that the two-sided portion starts on the right
%     side when printing.  This is not for use in submission, since the best
%     thing to do there is to print everything out one-sided, then take it down
%     to the copy store to have them do the rest.  It does help to save trees
%     when you are printing out copies just to look at them and fiddle with
%     things.
%
%
% EXAMPLES:
%
% The rest is up to you.  To fiddle with margins, use the \settextwidth and
% \setbindingoffset macros, described below.  I suggest that you
% \settextwidth{6.0in} for better-looking output (otherwise you'll get 3/4-inch
% margins after binding, which is sort of weird).  This will depend on the
% opinions of the various dean/coordinator folks, though, so be sure to ask
% them before embarking on a major formatting task.

% The following command fixes my particular printer, which starts 0.03 inches
% too low, shifting the whole page down by that amount.  This shifts the
% document content up so that it comes out right when printed.
%
% Discovering this sort of behavior is best done by specifying the ``grid''
% option in the class parameters above.  It prints a 1/2 inch grid on every
% page.  You can then use a ruler to determine exactly what the printer is
% doing.
%
% Uncomment to shift content up (accounting for printer problems)
%\setlength{\voffset}{-.03in}

% Here we set things up for invisible hyperlinks in the document.  This makes
% the electronic version clickable without changing the way that the document
% prints.  It's useful, but optional.
%
% NOTE: "driverfallback=ps2pdf" chooses ps2pdf in the case of LaTeX and pdftex
% in the case of pdflatex. If you use my LaTeX makefile (at
% http://latex-makefile.googlecode.com/) then pdftex is the default There are
% many other benefits to using the makefile, too.  This option is not always
% available, so use with care.

% To fiddle with the margin settings use the below.  DO NOT change stuff
% directly (like setting \textwidth) - it will break subtle things and you'll
% be tearing your hair out.
%
% For example, if you want 1.5in equal margins, or 2in and 1in margins when
% printing, add the following below:
%
%\setbindingoffset{1.0in}
%\settextwidth{5.5in}
%
% When equalmargins is specified in the class options, the margins will be
% equal at 1.5in each: (8.5 - 5.5) / 2.  When equalmargins is not specified,
% the inner margin will be 2.0 and the outer margin will be 1.0: inner = (8.5 -
% 5.5 - 1.0) / 2 + 1.0 (the 1.0 is the binding offset).
%
% The idea is this: you determine how much space the text is going to take up,
% whether for an electronic document (equalmargins) or not.  You don't want the
% layout shifting around between printed and electronic documents.
%
% So, you specify the text width.  Then, if there is a binding offset (when
% binding your thesis, the binding takes up space - usually 0.5 inches), that
% reduces the visual space on the final printed copy.  So, the *effective*
% margins are calculated by reducing the page size by the binding offset, then
% computing the remaining space and dividing by two.  Adding back in the
% binding offset gives the inner margin.  The outer margin is just what's left.
%
% All of this is done using the geometry package, which should be manipulated
% directly at your peril.  It's best just to use the above macros to manipulate
% your margins.
%
% That said, using the geometry macro to set top and bottom margins, or
% anything else vertical, is perfectly safe and encouraged, e.g.,
%
%\geometry{top=2.0in,bottom=2.0in}
%
% Just don't fiddle with horizontal margins this way.  You have been warned.

  Cervical cancer is one of the deadliest cancers amoung women worldwide. There were about 
  270,000 deaths a year, out of which 85\% occured in developing countries. One of the
  primary reasons of the inequality is the cost and availability of cancer screenings for early diagnosis.
  The goal of this project is to help in the development of low cost sensors and new algorithms to detect 
  cervical cancer for poor regions. Early diagnosis of this cancer is extreamly effective in treatment and 
  has the potential to save many lives.

  Recent advances in neural networks can be applied to the early detection of cervical cancer.
  The primary bottleneck is the lack of labeled data and cost of generating it. This project
  will focus on new ways of generating synthetic cell data and using it to augment state of the art computer 
  vision algorithms.

\chapter{Introduction}

Cervical cancer accounts for 6.6\% of cancer cases in the world. In 2018 alone, there were well
over 570,000 cases. Even worse is the disproportionate way populations are effected. About 85\%
of deaths from cervical cancer came from lot to middle income countries.\cite{15}
Fortunatly the high mortality rate from cervical cancer can be reduced by effective screening and early
treatment.

\section{The Pap smear screening}

The pap-smear screening was developed by Georges Papanicolaou. Using a small brush, a cytological sample is taken from the cervix and smeared onto a thin glass slide. 
To clarify the cells characteristics, the smear is stained using the Papanicolaou method. This emphisizes the different components of the cells with specific colors, making it more clear in a microscope.\cite{herlev2}
Each microscope slide contains up to 300,000 single cells with defferent orientations and overlap\cite{herlev2}. This has made automatic segmentation methods challenging.

\section{Project Goals}

The Goal of this project is to develop a data pipeline and tools to take in raw pap-smear slide data and output1
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Datasets}

Due to privacy with mediacl data and effort in labeling, there are only two open Pap smear datasets. For my project I use these two and make the pipeline generalizable
to future datasets.


\section{SIPaKMeD}
The datasets used are constructed by cyto-technicians for classification purposes. These technicians use a microsope witha resolution of  \SI{0.201}{\micro\metre} / pixel to grab every cell.

The SIPaKMeD dataset consists of 996 cluser cell images of Pap smear slides. From these there are
4049 indavidual cells that are segmented. These cells are then labeled in 5 categories: 
(a) Dyskeratotic, (b) Koilocytotic, (c) Metaplastic, (d) Parabasal and (e) Superficial-Intermediate.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \subcaptionbox{Dysketarotic}{\includegraphics[width=0.30\textwidth]{cells/dysketarotic_059}} \quad
  \subcaptionbox{Koilocytotic}{\includegraphics[width=0.30\textwidth]{cells/koilocytotic_110}} \quad

  \subcaptionbox{Parabasal}{\includegraphics[width=0.30\textwidth]{cells/parabasal_020}} \quad
  \subcaptionbox{Superficial-Intermediate}{\includegraphics[width=0.30\textwidth]{cells/superficial_intermediate_007}} 
  \caption{Cell Types}
\end{figure}

\noindent \textbf{Superficial-Intermediate cells} constitute the majority of the cells found in a Pap test. Usually they are flat with round, oval or polygonal shape cytoplasm stains mostly eosinophilic or cyanophilic. They contain a central pycnotic nucleus. They have well defined, large polygonal cytoplasm and easily recognized nuclear limits (small pycnotic in the superficial and vesicular nuclei in intermediate cells). These type of cells show the characteristics morphological changes (koilocytic atypia) due to more severe lessions.
\\ \textbf{Parabasal cells} are immature squamous cells and they are the smallest epithelial cells seen on a typical vaginal smear. The cytoplasm is generally cyanophilic and they usually contain a large vesicular nucleus. It must be noted that parabasal cells have similar morphological characteristic with the cells identified as metaplastic cells and it is difficult to be distinguished from them.    
\\ \textbf{Koilocytotic cells} correspond most commonly in mature squamous cells (intermediate and superficial) and some times in metaplastic type koilocytotic cells. They appear most often cyanophilic, very lightly stained and they are characterized by a large perinuclear cavity. The periphery of the cytoplasm is very dense stained. The nuclei of koilocytes are usually enlarged, eccentrically located, hyperchromatic and exhibit irregularity of the nuclear membrane contour. 
\\ \textbf{Dysketarotic cells} are squamous cells which undergone premature abnormal keratinization within individual cells or more often in three-dimensional clusters. They exhibit a brilliant orangeophilic cytoplasm. They are characterized by the presence of vesicular nuclei, identical to the nuclei of koilcytotic cells. In many cases there are binucleated and/or multinucleated cells.
\\ \textbf{Metaplastic Cells} are small or large parabasal-type cells with prominent cellular borders, often exhibiting eccentric nuclei and sometimes containing a large intracellular vacuole. The staining in the center portion is usually light brown and it often differs from that in the marginal portion. Also, there is essentially a darker-stained cytoplasm and they exhibit great uniformity of size and shape compared to the parabasal cells, as their characteristic is the well defined, almost round shape of cytoplasm.\cite{sipakmed}

\section{Herlev}
The Herlev dataset is comprised of 917 isolated single cell images. These are distributed unequally between seven classes of cells.  Superficial squamous epithelia, intermediate squamous epithelia, columnar epithelial, mild squamous non-keratinizing dysplasia, moderate squamous non-keratinizing dysplasia, severe squamous non-keratinizing dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma in situ intermediate.\cite{herlev}

\end{figure}

\section{Extensibility to future datasets}

Since we are developing a low cost sensor, all these tools I made will fit the new data into the pipline. This 
is done by simply extending the DatasetConnector class to put the data in the correct format. More details are given
in the attached API.


\chapter{Background}

\section{General Data Augmentation}

Data hungry neural networks make us need data augmentation. Depending on the domain of the data, severl different types 
of data augmentaion can be used. Very tradiional is fliping and rotating the data. Otheres include random color 
altertions, adding noise, random zooming, ect.

Current automatic screening scystems that incorperate pap smear have a very similar workflow: 
cell segmentation, cytoplasm and nuclei segmentation, feature extraction, and cell classification.
This is very limited and very sensitive to cell overlap.

Whole slide classification (no segmentation) \cite{kiran}

\chapter{Synthetic Data Generation}

There are lots of different manaul augmentations I do to the images...

\section{Inserting Cells}

This is where I randomly crop and segment labeled cells in other images. I place them onto
the image. To help it blend in more I take the hard segmentation boundy and dialate the mask.
I then do a Guassian filter to blur the opacity so it is not just a hard border on the
inserted images.

current challanges:

\begin{itemize}
  \item different size cells from different samples
  \item dosnt fit into the context when put randomly
  \item there are different colors of die that are not consistant accross classes (color correct somehow?)
  \item placing above other cells
\end{itemize}

\section{Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks}

Generative adversarial networks, GANs, are generative models that learn a mapping from 
a random noise vector $z$ to output image $y$, $G : z \rightarrow y$. A traditional GAN
can be broken down into 2 networks, the generator and the discriminator. The generator is $G$ 
described above. The goal of the discriminator is to take in a generated and real image and 
classify which is real.

Conditional GANs differ from this learning a mapping from an observed image, $x$, and a random noise vector $z$. This 
gives $G: \{ x, z \} \rightarrow y$. Mathematically the objective funcitn of a conditional GAN can be expressed as

$$\mathcal{L}_{cGAN} = \mathbb{E}_{x,y}[\log D(x,y)] + \mathbb{E}_{x,z}[\log (1 - D(x, G(x, z))]$$
